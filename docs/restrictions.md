# Restrictions

Restrictions can be configured in this plugin's `config.yaml` You may also use `/restrictions disallow <moduleSlug>` to add a module to the disallow list. Use `/restrictions allow <moduleSlug>` to remove it again and allow players to use that module.

**Most client TuffClient versions require all module slugs to be __all lowercase__.**
